    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hello,
        My name is Matt Stewart. I am currently a senior computer science major. I came to Lewis U. through the
        COD/Lewis 3+1 program. I currently live in Naperville and have one sister and one twin brother.
    </p><br />

    <h2>What I hope to learn</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>More about front end technologies such as Node, HTML/CSS.</li>
            <li>Participating in a project from conception through development to delivery.</li>
            <li>How to use a NOSQL database such as Mongo DB.</li>
            <li>How to utilize cloud services such as Azure.</li>
        </ul>
    </p><br />

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
        The hobby that I would like to dive deeper into is riding motercycles. I got my license a few years ago after taking an MSF safety course. I do not have my own motorcycle
        yet but it is definitely in my plans for the future.
        My other interests include running (I don't run as much as I used to though) and following the UFC.
    </p><br />

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>
        I have a previous degree from Miami University where I double majored in History and Social Justice Studies
        and minored in Geography.
